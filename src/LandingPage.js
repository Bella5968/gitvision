        <p className="description">
          GitVision was inspired by my personal journey as a software engineer. While exploring open-source contributions
          and GitHub analytics, I realized how difficult it was to get a clear, visual representation of my coding habits,
          repository activity, and language usage. This led me to build GitVisionâ€”a tool designed to make GitHub analytics
          more accessible and insightful for developers of all levels.
