## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gitvision.git
   cd gitvision

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the development server:
npm start

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000

Usage
Navigate to the Home tab to view the landing page with a project description.
Go to the Dashboard tab.
Enter a GitHub username in the search bar and click "Search."
View the user's GitHub profile details and repository statistics.
Core Algorithms
1. GitHub API Integration
Fetch user profile and repository data using Axios:
const onSearch = async (username) => {
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const repos = await axios.get(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos`);
    const profile = await axios.get(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`);
    setData({ repos: repos.data, profile: profile.data });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};

2. Routing
Navigate between the Home and Dashboard tabs using React Router:
<Router>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
  </Routes>
</Router>

3. Data Visualization
Render charts for repository activity and language usage:
{data && <Charts data={data} />}

Challenges and Solutions
1. GitHub API Rate Limits
Challenge: Frequent API requests could hit the rate limit.
Solution: Implement error handling and consider adding GitHub authentication for higher rate limits.
2. Navigation Issues
Challenge: Misconfigured routes caused navigation problems.
Solution: Properly configured react-router-dom with <Routes> and <Link> components.

3. Responsive Design
Challenge: Ensuring the app looks good on all devices.
Solution: Used CSS properties like max-width, width: 100%, and object-fit for responsiveness.
